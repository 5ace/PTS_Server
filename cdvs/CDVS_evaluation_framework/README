Please note that the MPEG CDVS TM must be compiled and run on a 64-bit machine running a 64-bit Linux OS.

Before running the "configure" script, the following packages must be installed:
1) jpeg-8c (or later version, from http://www.ijg.org/)
2) Eigen (install version 3.1.4 from http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)

Additionally, if the BFlog-based version of the library is to be installed, also
the following packages must be installed:
3) Fast Fourier transform library (libfftw3-3 on Ubuntu)

Before compiling the applications in the src directory, the configure script
needs to be generated once.
# create the configure script
sh autogen.sh

Then, the usual ./configure, make, make install will build and install all CDVS
libraries and executables.
Notice that, by default, only the standard version of the CDVS library is built 
and installed. The BFlog and LowMem versions of the libraries can be optionally
built and installed passing the configure script the options --with-bflog and
--with-lowmem respectively.
If compiling the code using gcc and g++, the following settings can be used to optimize the C++ and C code.

# optimize g++ and gcc 
# WITHOUT multithreading (as required by MPEG in crosscheck verification):
CFLAGS="-march=native -O3 -mpopcnt -DNDEBUG -pipe"
# WITH multithreading (can be used to speed up internal tests):
CFLAGS="-march=native -O3 -mpopcnt -DNDEBUG -fopenmp -pipe"
# run configure with optimization flags
mkdir build
cd build
../configure --prefix=$HOME CFLAGS="${CFLAGS}" CXXFLAGS="${CFLAGS}" 
# build all binaries:
make 
# install all binaries in your own $HOME/bin directory:
make install
# cleanup the build tree:
make distclean
